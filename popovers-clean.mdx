## Introduction

Popovers in Chassis CSS provide rich contextual overlays that display detailed information, forms, or interactive content without leaving the current page context. Built on modern web standards with intelligent positioning via Popper.js, popovers integrate seamlessly with your design system while maintaining accessibility and performance excellence.

Unlike simple tooltips, popovers support complex content including headers, body sections, and interactive elements. The positioning system automatically handles viewport constraints and collision detection, while the component architecture ensures consistent behavior across devices and screen sizes.

Chassis CSS popovers operate on explicit initialization for optimal performance:

- Manual initialization prevents overhead on unused elements
- Intelligent positioning powered by Popper.js with automatic placement adjustment
- Comprehensive event integration for application logic and user interaction
- Accessibility through proper ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation support
- CSS custom properties enable seamless theming and brand consistency

### Implementation requirements

Before implementing popovers, ensure these dependencies and considerations are addressed:

- Include [popper.min.js]([[config:cdn.popper]]) before `chassis.js`, or use `chassis.bundle.min.js`
- Popovers with empty `title` and `content` values will not display
- Hidden elements cannot trigger popovers
- Use `container: 'body'` for complex component layouts (input groups, button groups)
- Apply popovers only to keyboard-focusable, interactive elements for accessibility compliance
- Hide popovers before removing their trigger elements from the DOM
- Specify explicit containers for popovers within modal dialogs to ensure proper focus management

## Examples

Explore practical popover implementations demonstrating initialization patterns, positioning strategies, and customization techniques. These examples showcase Chassis CSS's flexible popover system across various use cases.

### Initialization patterns

Initialize popovers via JavaScript before they can be used. Select elements by their `data-cx-toggle` attribute for batch initialization:

```js
const popoverTriggerList = document.querySelectorAll('[data-cx-toggle="popover"]')
const popoverList = [...popoverTriggerList].map(popoverTriggerEl => new chassis.Popover(popoverTriggerEl))
```

### Interactive demonstration

This example demonstrates a fully functional popover with title and body content. Titles are set via `data-cx-title` and body content via `data-cx-content`.

<Callout name="warning-data-cx-title-vs-title" type="warning" />

<Example addStackblitzJs code={`<button type="button" class="button large danger" data-cx-toggle="popover" data-cx-title="Popover title" data-cx-content="And here's some amazing content. It's very engaging. Right?">Click to toggle popover</button>`} />

### Positioning system

Chassis CSS supports four directional placements with automatic RTL adaptation. Set `data-cx-placement` to control popover direction with intelligent fallback positioning.

<Example addStackblitzJs code={`<button type="button" class="button secondary" data-cx-container="body" data-cx-toggle="popover" data-cx-placement="top" data-cx-content="Top popover">
    Popover on top
  </button>
  <button type="button" class="button secondary" data-cx-container="body" data-cx-toggle="popover" data-cx-placement="right" data-cx-content="Right popover">
    Popover on right
  </button>
  <button type="button" class="button secondary" data-cx-container="body" data-cx-toggle="popover" data-cx-placement="bottom" data-cx-content="Bottom popover">
    Popover on bottom
  </button>
  <button type="button" class="button secondary" data-cx-container="body" data-cx-toggle="popover" data-cx-placement="left" data-cx-content="Left popover">
    Popover on left
  </button>`} />

### Container control

When parent elements interfere with popover positioning, specify a custom `container` to control where the popover appears in the DOM:

```js
const popover = new chassis.Popover('.example-popover', {
  container: 'body'
})
```

For popovers within [modal dialogs]([[docsref:/components/modal]]), set the container to the modal to ensure proper focus management and interaction:

```js
const popover = new chassis.Popover('.example-popover', {
  container: '.modal-body'
})
```

### Custom appearance

Customize popover appearance using CSS custom properties. Apply custom classes with `data-cx-custom-class="custom-popover"` to scope styling and override CSS variables for brand-specific theming.

<ScssDocs name="custom-popovers" file="site/src/scss/_component-examples.scss" />

<Example addStackblitzJs class="custom-popover-demo" code={`<button type="button" class="button secondary"
          data-cx-toggle="popover" data-cx-placement="right"
          data-cx-custom-class="custom-popover"
          data-cx-title="Custom popover"
          data-cx-content="This popover is themed via CSS variables.">
    Custom popover
  </button>`} />

### Focus-based dismissal

Use the `focus` trigger to dismiss popovers when users interact with other elements, ideal for contextual help and secondary information.

<Callout type="danger">
**Focus-based dismissal requires specific HTML for proper cross-browser behavior.** Use `<a>` elements with `tabindex` attributes instead of `<button>` elements to ensure consistent keyboard and mouse interaction across all browsers and platforms.
</Callout>

<Example addStackblitzJs code={`<a tabindex="0" class="button large danger" role="button" data-cx-toggle="popover" data-cx-trigger="focus" data-cx-title="Dismissible popover" data-cx-content="And here's some amazing content. It's very engaging. Right?">Dismissible popover</a>`} />

```js
const popover = new chassis.Popover('.popover-dismiss', {
  trigger: 'focus'
})
```

### Disabled elements

Elements with the `disabled` attribute cannot trigger popovers directly. Use a wrapper element with `tabindex="0"` to enable popover functionality while maintaining accessibility:

<Example addStackblitzJs code={`<span class="d-inline-block" tabindex="0" data-cx-toggle="popover" data-cx-trigger="hover focus" data-cx-content="Disabled popover">
    <button class="button primary" type="button" disabled>Disabled button</button>
  </span>`} />

<Callout type="info">
For disabled elements, use `data-cx-trigger="hover focus"` to provide immediate visual feedback since users may not expect to click disabled elements.
</Callout>

## CSS

Customize popover appearance and behavior through Chassis CSS's comprehensive styling system, featuring CSS custom properties and Sass variables for design system integration.

<DocsCSS />

### Custom properties

Chassis CSS popovers utilize CSS custom properties for runtime customization and design token integration. Local CSS variables on `.popover` enable dynamic theming while maintaining backward compatibility.

<DocsCSSVars />

<ScssDocs name="popover-css-vars" file="scss/_popover.scss" />

### Sass variables

Design system integration through Sass variables provides comprehensive popover customization for build-time theming and brand alignment.

<DocsSASSVars />

<ScssDocs name="popover-variables" file="scss/_variables.scss" />

## JavaScript API

Control popover behavior programmatically with Chassis CSS's comprehensive JavaScript interface, featuring dynamic content generation, intelligent positioning, and accessibility features.

The popover plugin generates content and markup on demand, placing popovers relative to their trigger elements for optimal performance and accessibility. Initialize popovers via JavaScript:

```js
const exampleEl = document.getElementById('example')
const popover = new chassis.Popover(exampleEl, options)
```

<Callout type="warning">
**Maintain accessibility when using popovers** by applying them only to traditionally keyboard-focusable and interactive elements (links, form inputs, buttons). While other elements can receive focus with `tabindex="0"`, this creates confusing navigation patterns for keyboard users and may not be announced properly by assistive technologies.

Avoid excessive content in popovers with the `html` option. Popover content is tied to trigger elements via `aria-describedby`, causing all content to be announced as one continuous stream to screen reader users.

Popovers don't manage keyboard focus order automatically. Their DOM placement can be unpredictable, so exercise caution when including interactive elements like forms or links, as this may create illogical focus sequences or unreachable content for keyboard users.
</Callout>

### Data attributes

Configure popover behavior using data attributes on trigger elements:

<JsDataAttributes />

<Callout type="warning">
For security reasons, the `sanitize`, `sanitizeFn`, and `allowList` options cannot be supplied using data attributes.
</Callout>

### Configuration options

<CxTable>
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `allowList` | object | [Default value]([[docsref:/getting-started/javascript#sanitizer]]) | Object containing allowed attributes and tags for HTML sanitization. |
| `animation` | boolean | `true` | Apply CSS fade transition to the popover. |
| `boundary` | string, element | `'clippingParents'` | Overflow constraint boundary of the popover (applies only to Popper's preventOverflow modifier). Accepts `'clippingParents'` or an HTMLElement reference. For more information refer to Popper's [detectOverflow docs](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/utils/detect-overflow/#boundary). |
| `container` | string, element, false | `false` | Appends the popover to a specific element. Example: `container: 'body'`. This option prevents the popover from floating away from the triggering element during window resize. |
| `content` | string, element, function | `''` | The popover's text content. If a function is given, it will be called with its `this` reference set to the element that the popover is attached to. |
| `customClass` | string, function | `''` | Add classes to the popover when shown. Note that these classes are added in addition to template classes. To add multiple classes, separate them with spaces: `'class-1 class-2'`. Functions should return a single string containing additional class names. |
| `delay` | number, object | `0` | Delay showing and hiding the popover (ms)—doesn't apply to manual trigger type. If a number is supplied, delay is applied to both hide/show. Object structure is: `delay: { "show": 500, "hide": 100 }`. |
| `fallbackPlacements` | string, array | `['top', 'right', 'bottom', 'left']` | Define fallback placements by providing a list of placements in array (in order of preference). For more information refer to Popper's [behavior docs](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/modifiers/flip/#fallbackplacements). |
| `html` | boolean | `false` | Allow HTML in the popover. If true, HTML tags in the popover's `title` will be rendered. If false, `innerText` property will be used to insert content into the DOM. Use text if you're concerned about XSS attacks. |
| `offset` | number, string, function | `[0, 8]` | Offset of the popover relative to its target. You can pass a string in data attributes with comma separated values like: `data-cx-offset="10,20"`. When a function is used to determine the offset, it is called with an object containing the popper placement, the reference, and popper rects as its first argument. The triggering element DOM node is passed as the second argument. The function must return an array with two numbers: [skidding](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/modifiers/offset/#skidding-1), [distance](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/modifiers/offset/#distance-1). For more information refer to Popper's [offset docs](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/modifiers/offset/#options). |
| `placement` | string, function | `'right'` | How to position the popover: auto, top, bottom, left, right. When `auto` is specified, it will dynamically reorient the popover. When a function is used to determine the placement, it is called with the popover DOM node as its first argument and the triggering element DOM node as its second. The `this` context is set to the popover instance. |
| `popperConfig` | null, object, function | `null` | To change Chassis CSS's default Popper config, see [Popper's configuration](https://popper.js.org/docs/v2/constructors/#options). When a function is used to create the Popper configuration, it's called with an object that contains the Chassis CSS's default Popper configuration. It helps you use and merge the default with your own configuration. The function must return a configuration object for Popper. |
| `sanitize` | boolean | `true` | Enable or disable the sanitization. If activated `'template'`, `'content'` and `'title'` options will be sanitized. |
| `sanitizeFn` | null, function | `null` | Here you can supply your own sanitize function. This can be useful if you prefer to use a dedicated library to perform sanitization. |
| `selector` | string, false | `false` | If a selector is provided, popover objects will be delegated to the specified targets. In practice, this is used to also apply popovers to dynamically added DOM elements. See [this issue]([[config:repo]]/issues/4215) and [an informative example](https://codepen.io/Johann-S/pen/djJYPb). **Note**: `title` attribute must not be used as a selector. |
| `template` | string | `'<div class="popover" role="tooltip"><div class="popover-arrow"></div><h3 class="popover-header"></h3><div class="popover-body"></div></div>'` | Base HTML to use when creating the popover. The popover's `title` will be injected into the `.popover-header`. The popover's `content` will be injected into the `.popover-body`. `.popover-arrow` will become the popover's arrow. The outermost wrapper element should have the `.popover` class and `role="tooltip"`. |
| `title` | string, element, function | `''` | The popover title. If a function is given, it will be called with its `this` reference set to the element that the popover is attached to. |
| `trigger` | string | `'click'` | How popover is triggered: click, hover, focus, manual. You may pass multiple triggers; separate them with a space. `'manual'` indicates that the popover will be triggered programmatically via the `.popover('show')`, `.popover('hide')` and `.popover('toggle')` methods; this value cannot be combined with any other trigger. `'hover'` on its own will result in popovers that cannot be triggered via the keyboard, and should only be used if alternative methods for conveying the same information for keyboard users is present. |
</CxTable>

#### Data attributes for individual popovers

Options for individual popovers can alternatively be specified through the use of data attributes, as explained above.

#### Using function with `popperConfig`

```js
const popover = new chassis.Popover(element, {
  popperConfig(defaultCxPopperConfig) {
    // const newPopperConfig = {...}
    // use defaultCxPopperConfig if needed...
    // return newPopperConfig
  }
})
```

### Methods

Chassis CSS provides a comprehensive set of methods for programmatic popover control, enabling dynamic content updates and lifecycle management.

<Callout name="danger-async-methods" type="danger" />

<CxTable>
| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `disable` | Removes the ability for an element's popover to be shown. The popover will only be able to be shown if it is re-enabled. |
| `dispose` | Hides and destroys an element's popover (Removes stored data on the DOM element). Popovers that use delegation (which are created using [the `selector` option](#options)) cannot be individually destroyed on descendant trigger elements. |
| `enable` | Gives an element's popover the ability to be shown. **Popovers are enabled by default.** |
| `getInstance` | *Static* method which allows you to get the popover instance associated with a DOM element. |
| `getOrCreateInstance` | *Static* method which allows you to get the popover instance associated with a DOM element, or create a new one in case it wasn't initialized. |
| `hide` | Hides an element's popover. **Returns to the caller before the popover has actually been hidden** (i.e. before the `hidden.cx.popover` event occurs). This is considered a "manual" triggering of the popover. |
| `setContent` | Gives a way to change the popover's content after its initialization. |
| `show` | Reveals an element's popover. **Returns to the caller before the popover has actually been shown** (i.e. before the `shown.cx.popover` event occurs). This is considered a "manual" triggering of the popover. Popovers whose title and content are both zero-length are never displayed. |
| `toggle` | Toggles an element's popover. **Returns to the caller before the popover has actually been shown or hidden** (i.e. before the `shown.cx.popover` or `hidden.cx.popover` event occurs). This is considered a "manual" triggering of the popover. |
| `toggleEnabled` | Toggles the ability for an element's popover to be shown or hidden. |
| `update` | Updates the position of an element's popover. |
</CxTable>

```js
// getOrCreateInstance example
const popover = chassis.Popover.getOrCreateInstance('#example') // Returns a Chassis CSS popover instance

// setContent example
popover.setContent({
  '.popover-header': 'another title',
  '.popover-body': 'another content'
})
```

<Callout>
The `setContent` method accepts an `object` argument, where each property-key is a valid `string` selector within the popover template, and each related property-value can be `string` | `element` | `function` | `null`
</Callout>

### Events

<CxTable>
| Event | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `hide.cx.popover` | This event is fired immediately when the `hide` instance method has been called. |
| `hidden.cx.popover` | This event is fired when the popover has finished being hidden from the user (will wait for CSS transitions to complete). |
| `inserted.cx.popover` | This event is fired after the `show.cx.popover` event when the popover template has been added to the DOM. |
| `show.cx.popover` | This event fires immediately when the `show` instance method is called. |
| `shown.cx.popover` | This event is fired when the popover has been made visible to the user (will wait for CSS transitions to complete). |
</CxTable>

```js
const myPopoverTrigger = document.getElementById('myPopover')
myPopoverTrigger.addEventListener('hidden.cx.popover', () => {
  // do something...
})
```
