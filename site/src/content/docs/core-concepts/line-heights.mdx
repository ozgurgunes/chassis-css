description: Don't stuck in to `1.5em` line heights for headings. Chassis - CSS provides individual line heights for every font size classes.

Of course we believe 150% line height is ideal for readability but for which size and distance? On screen design, larger fonts need slightly lesser line height than their descendants for both readability and feelings.

Also design side may be problematic with percentage based line heights. Layers not align properly or separator lines get lost in sub-pixel etc.

<Callout>
**Heads up!** Chassis - CSS design system lets designer pick separate line-height for every font size and push them directly to code by design tokens.

<div class="cxd-example">
<div>
<p class="h2">This is a long heading text with a specific line-height value coming from design tokens.</p>
<p>The line-height CSS property sets the height of a line box. It's commonly used to set the distance between lines of text. On block-level elements, it specifies the minimum height of line boxes within the element.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="cxd-example">
<div>
<p class="h2" style="line-height: 1.5em">This is a long heading text with a standard 1.5em line-height of most design systems.</p>
<p>The line-height CSS property sets the height of a line box. It's commonly used to set the distance between lines of text. On block-level elements, it specifies the minimum height of line boxes within the element.</p>
</div>

It is still possible to adjust line-height with `lh-*` utility.

<Example code={`<p class="lh-1">The line-height CSS property sets the height of a line box. It's commonly used to set the distance between lines of text. On block-level elements, it specifies the minimum height of line boxes within the element.</p>
<p class="lh-small">The line-height CSS property sets the height of a line box. It's commonly used to set the distance between lines of text. On block-level elements, it specifies the minimum height of line boxes within the element.</p>
<p class="lh-base">The line-height CSS property sets the height of a line box. It's commonly used to set the distance between lines of text. On block-level elements, it specifies the minimum height of line boxes within the element.</p>
<p class="lh-large">The line-height CSS property sets the height of a line box. It's commonly used to set the distance between lines of text. On block-level elements, it specifies the minimum height of line boxes within the element.</p>`} />
