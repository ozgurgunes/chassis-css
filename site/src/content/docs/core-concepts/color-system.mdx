## Base Colors

Seven colors are chosen based on brand identity and UI context, with primitive color palettes created for each.

<div class="overflow-scroll text-nowrap mb-medium">
  <div class="grid font-code" style="--cx-grid-columns: 11; --cx-grid-gap: var(--cx-space-2xsmall);">
  {
    getData('colors').map((color) => {
      return (
        <div class="grid" style="width: 12rem; --cx-grid-columns: 1; grid-template-rows: auto;">
          <div class={`p-medium rounded-small mb-xsmall position-relative swatch-${color.name} bg-${color.name} fg-contrast`}>
            <strong class="d-block">{color.name}</strong>
            {sassVars('color')?.[color.name]}
          </div>
          <div class={`p-medium rounded-small cxd-${color.name}-05`}>{color.name}-05</div>
            {
              Array.from({ length: 9 }, (_, i) => {
                const value = (i + 1) * 10; // Generates 10, 20, ..., 90
                return <div class={`p-medium rounded-small cxd-${color.name}-${value}`}>{color.name}-{value}</div>
              })
            }
          <div class={`p-medium rounded-small cxd-${color.name}-95`}>{color.name}-95</div>
        </div>
      )
    })
  }
  </div>
</div>

These colors are not utilized by classes for any property and are available as CSS variables to use in components if needed.

## Context Colors

For basic use, two variable colors —in addition to black and white— have been added, which behave differently in light and dark modes.

These **11** colors are named as `context colors`.

<div class="row g-xsmall mb-medium font-code">
  {
    getData('context-colors').map((color) => {
      return (
        <div class="col-medium-4">
          <div class={`p-medium m-0 bg-${color.name} fg-contrast rounded-small`}>--cx-{color.name}</div>
        </div>
      )
    })
  }
</div>

The `default` is the body color used for dark text on light background in light mode. The `alternate` is for emphasized content on the page, used for light text on colored backgrounds such as sections of a page, sidebars, banners, etc.

While `default` usually inverts in dark mode, `alternate` may stay the same depending on the design.

### Context Palettes

Common color needs of UI design have been defined, categorized, and named by their area of use. Palettes for each `context color` have been created by referencing primitive color palettes.

<ContextPalette />

These colors are created using `base color` and `opacity` references. This is done by design tokens, but here is an example Sass version to make it clear.

```sass
// Light theme
$default-fg-main:      $black;
$default-fg-subtle:    rgba($default-fg-main-rgb, $opacity-fg-subtle);
$default-fg-slight:    rgba($default-fg-main-rgb, $opacity-fg-slight);
$default-bg-main:      $white;
$default-bg-even:      $neutral-05;
$default-bg-evident:   $neutral-10;
```

### Body Colors

From the context colors, the `default` palette is copied as the `body` palette, which can be set in options. Newly copied colors don't get a context prefix and become like `--cx-fg-main`, which is a copy of `--cx-default-fg-main`.

The body palette created above is used to declare body variables, which are then assigned to the related properties of the body and its children.

<BodyPalette />

Switching between these palettes in contextual components is done by changing CSS variables.

## Examples

The `context` class changes the palette first then re-assigns the body colors with the new context.

### Context Class

Switching between contexts is like moving horizontally on the context palettes.

<Example code={[`<p class="p-xsmall">
    <span class="icon icon-info-circle-solid"></span>
    This is body context <a href="#">with link</a>, same as default.
  </p>`].concat(getData('context-colors').map((color) => `<p class="context ${color.name} p-xsmall">
    <span class="icon icon-info-circle-solid"></span>
    This is ${color.name} context <a href="#">with link</a>.
  </p>`))} />

### Context Style

It is also possible to easily switch between component styles by changing body colors, like moving vertically on the `context` palette.

<Example code={`<p class="context primary p-xsmall">
    <span class="icon icon-info-circle-solid"></span>
    This is a basic context component <a href="#">with link</a>.
  </p>
  <p class="context primary solid p-xsmall">
    <span class="icon icon-info-circle-solid"></span>
    This is a solid context component <a href="#">with link</a>.
  </p>
  <p class="context primary smooth p-xsmall">
    <span class="icon icon-info-circle-solid"></span>
    This is a smooth context component <a href="#">with link</a>.
  </p>
  <p class="context primary outline p-xsmall">
    <span class="icon icon-info-circle-solid"></span>
    This is an outline context component <a href="#">with link</a>.
  </p>`} />

## Summary

The Chassis - CSS's color system provides a structured approach to managing colors in a UI design. By defining base colors and context colors, and creating context palettes, it ensures consistency and flexibility. For more details, check out the [documentation]([[docsref:/customize/color]]) pages for customizing colors or visit the [color]([[docsref:/utilities/colors]]) and [background]([[docsref:/utilities/background]]) utility pages for more examples. Additionally, see the [Context Class]([[docsref:/core-concepts/context-class]]) page for more explanation, code examples, and tips for creating your components.
