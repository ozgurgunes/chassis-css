## How it works

Vertical rules are inspired by the `<hr>` element, allowing you to create vertical dividers in common layouts. They’re styled just like `<hr>` elements:

- They’re `1px` wide
- They have `min-height` of `1em`
- Their color is set via `$vr-color` and `$vr-opacity`

Customize them with additional styles as needed.

## Example

<Example code={`<div class="vr"></div>`} />

Vertical rules scale their height in flex layouts:

<Example code={`<div class="d-flex" style="height: 200px;">
    <div class="vr"></div>
  </div>`} />

## With stacks

They can also be used in [stacks]([[docsref:/utilities/stacks]]):

<Example class="cxd-example-flex" code={`<div class="hstack gap-medium">
    <div class="p-xsmall">First item</div>
    <div class="p-xsmall ms-auto">Second item</div>
    <div class="vr"></div>
    <div class="p-xsmall">Third item</div>
  </div>`} />

## CSS

### Sass variables

Customize the vertical rule Sass variable to change its width.

<ScssDocs name="vr-variables" file="scss/_variables.scss" />
