## How it works

Set the `visibility` of elements with our visibility utilities. These utility classes do not modify the `display` value at all and do not affect layout – `.invisible` elements still take up space in the page.

<Callout type="warning">
Elements with the `.invisible` class will be hidden *both* visually and for assistive technology/screen reader users.
</Callout>

Apply `.visible` or `.invisible` as needed.

```html
<div class="visible">...</div>
<div class="invisible">...</div>
```

```scss
// Class
.visible {
  visibility: visible !important;
}
.invisible {
  visibility: hidden !important;
}
```

## Visually hidden

Visually hide an element while still allowing it to be exposed to assistive technologies (such as screen readers) with `.visually-hidden`. Use `.visually-hidden-focusable` to visually hide an element by default, but to display it when it’s focused (e.g. by a keyboard-only user). `.visually-hidden-focusable` can also be applied to a container–thanks to `:focus-within`, the container will be displayed when any child element of the container receives focus.

<Example code={`<h2 class="visually-hidden">Title for screen readers</h2>
  <a class="visually-hidden-focusable" href="#content">Skip to main content</a>
  <div class="visually-hidden-focusable">A container with a <a href="#">focusable element</a>.</div>`} />

Both `visually-hidden` and `visually-hidden-focusable` can also be used as mixins.

```scss
// Usage as a mixin

.visually-hidden-title {
  @include visually-hidden;
}

.skip-navigation {
  @include visually-hidden-focusable;
}
```
