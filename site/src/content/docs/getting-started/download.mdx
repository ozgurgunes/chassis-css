## Compiled CSS and JS

Download ready-to-use compiled code for **Chassis - CSS v[[config:current_version]]** to easily drop into your project, which includes:

- Compiled and minified CSS bundles (see [CSS files comparison]([[docsref:/getting-started/contents#css-files]]))
- Compiled and minified JavaScript plugins (see [JS files comparison]([[docsref:/getting-started/contents#js-files]]))

This doesn’t include documentation, source files, or any optional JavaScript dependencies like Popper.

## Source files

Compile Chassis - CSS with your own asset pipeline by downloading our source Sass, JavaScript, and documentation files. This option requires some additional tooling:

- [Sass compiler]([[docsref:/getting-started/contribute#sass]]) for compiling Sass source files into CSS files
- [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer) for CSS vendor prefixing

Should you require our full set of [build tools]([[docsref:/getting-started/contribute#tooling-setup]]), they are included for developing Chassis - CSS and its docs, but they’re likely unsuitable for your own purposes.

## Examples

If you want to download and examine our [examples]([[docsref:/examples]]), you can grab the already built examples:

## CDN via jsDelivr

Skip the download with [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) to deliver cached version of Chassis - CSS’s compiled CSS and JS to your project.

```html
<link href="[[config:cdn.css]]" rel="stylesheet" integrity="[[config:cdn.css_hash]]" crossorigin="anonymous">
<script src="[[config:cdn.js_bundle]]" integrity="[[config:cdn.js_bundle_hash]]" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

If you’re using our compiled JavaScript and prefer to include Popper separately, add Popper before our JS, via a CDN preferably.

```html
<script src="[[config:cdn.popper]]" integrity="[[config:cdn.popper_hash]]" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
<script src="[[config:cdn.js]]" integrity="[[config:cdn.js_hash]]" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

### Alternative CDNs

We recommend [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/) and use it ourselves in our documentation. However, in some cases—like in some specific countries or environments—you may need to use other CDN providers like [cdnjs](https://cdnjs.com/) or [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/).

You’ll find the same files on these CDN providers, albeit with different URLs. With cdnjs, you can [use this direct Chassis - CSS package link](https://cdnjs.com/libraries/chassis) to copy and paste ready-to-use HTML snippets for each dist file from any version of Chassis.

<Callout type="warning">
**If the SRI hashes differ for a given file, you shouldn’t use the files from that CDN, because it means that the file was modified by someone else.**
</Callout>

Note that you should compare same length hashes, e.g. `sha384` with `sha384`, otherwise it’s expected for them to be different.
As such, you can use an online tool like [SRI Hash Generator](https://www.srihash.org/) to make sure that the hashes are the same for a given file.
Alternatively, assuming you have OpenSSL installed, you can achieve the same from the CLI, for example:

```sh
openssl dgst -sha384 -binary chassis.min.js | openssl base64 -A
```

## Package managers

Pull in Chassis - CSS’s **source files** into nearly any project with some of the most popular package managers. No matter the package manager, Chassis - CSS will **require a [Sass compiler]([[docsref:/getting-started/contribute#sass]]) and [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/postcss/autoprefixer)** for a setup that matches our official compiled versions.

### npm

Install Chassis - CSS in your Node.js powered apps with [the npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chassis):

```sh
npm install chassis@[[config:current_version]]
```

`const chassis = require('chassis-css')` or `import chassis from 'chassis-css'` will load all of Chassis - CSS’s plugins onto a `chassis` object.
The `chassis` module itself exports all of our plugins. You can manually load Chassis - CSS’s plugins individually by loading the `/js/dist/*.js` files under the package’s top-level directory.

Chassis - CSS’s `package.json` contains some additional metadata under the following keys:

- `sass` - path to Chassis - CSS’s main [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) source file
- `style` - path to Chassis - CSS’s non-minified CSS that’s been compiled using the default settings (no customization)

<Callout name="info-npm-starter" />

### yarn

Install Chassis - CSS in your Node.js powered apps with [the yarn package](https://yarnpkg.com/en/package/chassis):

```sh
yarn add chassis@[[config:current_version]]
```

<Callout type="warning">
**Yarn 2+ (aka Yarn Berry) doesn’t support the `node_modules` directory by default**: using our [Sass & JS example](https://github.com/twbs/examples/tree/main/sass-js) needs some adjustments:

```sh
yarn config set nodeLinker node-modules # Use the node_modules linker
touch yarn.lock # Create an empty yarn.lock file
yarn install # Install the dependencies
yarn start # Start the project
```
</Callout>

### Bun

Install Chassis - CSS in your Bun or Node.js powered apps with [the Bun CLI](https://bun.sh/):

```sh
bun add chassis@[[config:current_version]]
```

### RubyGems

Install Chassis - CSS in your Ruby apps using [Bundler](https://bundler.io/) (**recommended**) and [RubyGems](https://rubygems.org/) by adding the following line to your [`Gemfile`](https://bundler.io/guides/gemfile.html):

```ruby
gem 'chassis-css', '~> [[config:current_ruby_version]]'
```

Alternatively, if you’re not using Bundler, you can install the gem by running this command:

```sh
gem install chassis-css -v [[config:current_ruby_version]]
```

[See the gem’s README](https://github.com/twbs/chassis-rubygem/blob/main/README.md) for further details.

### Composer

You can also install and manage Chassis - CSS’s Sass and JavaScript using [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/):

```sh
composer require twbs/chassis:[[config:current_version]]
```

### NuGet

If you develop in .NET Framework, you can also install and manage Chassis - CSS’s [CSS](https://www.nuget.org/packages/chassis-css/) or [Sass](https://www.nuget.org/packages/chassis.sass/) and JavaScript using [NuGet](https://www.nuget.org/). Newer projects should use [libman](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/client-side/libman/) or another method as NuGet is designed for compiled code, not frontend assets.

```powershell
Install-Package chassis
```

```powershell
Install-Package chassis.sass
```
