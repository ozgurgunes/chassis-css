## Overview

Offcanvas creates slide-out panels that appear from any edge of the viewport, perfect for navigation menus, shopping carts, filters, or contextual information that needs to be accessible but not always visible. These panels maintain focus and accessibility while providing smooth animations and flexible positioning.

Built with responsive design principles and keyboard navigation support, offcanvas panels offer flexible sizing options, backdrop controls, and seamless integration with other Chassis CSS components. Each offcanvas consists of:

- Offcanvas container controls visibility and positioning
- Offcanvas header provides structure with title and close button
- Offcanvas body contains the main panel content

<Example class="cxd-example-offcanvas p-0 bg-evident overflow-hidden" code={`<div class="offcanvas offcanvas-start show" tabindex="-1" id="offcanvas" aria-labelledby="offcanvasLabel">
    <div class="offcanvas-header">
      <h5 class="offcanvas-title" id="offcanvasLabel">Offcanvas</h5>
      <button type="button" class="close-button" data-cx-dismiss="offcanvas" aria-label="Close"></button>
    </div>
    <div class="offcanvas-body">
      Content for the offcanvas goes here. You can place just about any Chassis CSS component or custom elements here.
    </div>
  </div>`} />

### Implementation

Before implementing offcanvas panels, note these important considerations:

- Offcanvas shares JavaScript functionality with modals but operates as a separate plugin
- When shown, offcanvas includes a default backdrop that can be clicked to hide the panel
- Only one offcanvas can be displayed at a time by default
- Body scrolling is disabled when an offcanvas is visible unless configured otherwise
- Use `margin` or `translate` on wrapper elements instead of the `.offcanvas` element directly due to CSS animation handling

## Examples

Explore these practical examples to see Chassis CSS offcanvas in action across different use cases and configurations. Each example demonstrates specific features to help you implement offcanvas panels effectively in your projects.

### Live demo

Use the buttons below to show and hide an offcanvas element via JavaScript that toggles the `.show` class. You can trigger offcanvas with both links using `href` or buttons using `data-cx-target`.

<Example code={`<a class="button primary" data-cx-toggle="offcanvas" href="#offcanvasExample" role="button" aria-controls="offcanvasExample">
    Link with href
  </a>
  <button class="button primary" type="button" data-cx-toggle="offcanvas" data-cx-target="#offcanvasExample" aria-controls="offcanvasExample">
    Button with data-cx-target
  </button>

  <div class="offcanvas offcanvas-start" tabindex="-1" id="offcanvasExample" aria-labelledby="offcanvasExampleLabel">
    <div class="offcanvas-header">
      <h5 class="offcanvas-title" id="offcanvasExampleLabel">Offcanvas</h5>
      <button type="button" class="close-button" data-cx-dismiss="offcanvas" aria-label="Close"></button>
    </div>
    <div class="offcanvas-body">
      <div>
        Some text as placeholder. In real life you can have the elements you have chosen. Like, text, images, lists, etc.
      </div>
      <div class="dropdown mt-medium">
        <button class="button secondary dropdown-toggle" type="button" data-cx-toggle="dropdown">
          Dropdown button
        </button>
        <ul class="dropdown-menu">
          <li><a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Action</a></li>
          <li><a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Another action</a></li>
          <li><a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Something else here</a></li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>`} />

### Body scrolling options

Control how the page body behaves when an offcanvas is visible. By default, body scrolling is disabled to focus attention on the offcanvas content.

#### Enable body scrolling

Use the `data-cx-scroll="true"` attribute to allow the body to scroll while the offcanvas is open. This is useful for reference panels or filters where users might need to scroll the main content.

<Example code={`<button class="button primary" type="button" data-cx-toggle="offcanvas" data-cx-target="#offcanvasScrolling" aria-controls="offcanvasScrolling">Enable body scrolling</button>

  <div class="offcanvas offcanvas-start" data-cx-scroll="true" data-cx-backdrop="false" tabindex="-1" id="offcanvasScrolling" aria-labelledby="offcanvasScrollingLabel">
    <div class="offcanvas-header">
      <h5 class="offcanvas-title" id="offcanvasScrollingLabel">Offcanvas with body scrolling</h5>
      <button type="button" class="close-button" data-cx-dismiss="offcanvas" aria-label="Close"></button>
    </div>
    <div class="offcanvas-body">
      <p>Try scrolling the rest of the page to see this option in action.</p>
    </div>
  </div>`} />

#### Body scrolling with backdrop

You can also enable body scrolling while maintaining a visible backdrop for better visual separation.

<Example code={`<button class="button primary" type="button" data-cx-toggle="offcanvas" data-cx-target="#offcanvasWithBothOptions" aria-controls="offcanvasWithBothOptions">Enable both scrolling & backdrop</button>

  <div class="offcanvas offcanvas-start" data-cx-scroll="true" tabindex="-1" id="offcanvasWithBothOptions" aria-labelledby="offcanvasWithBothOptionsLabel">
    <div class="offcanvas-header">
      <h5 class="offcanvas-title" id="offcanvasWithBothOptionsLabel">Backdrop with scrolling</h5>
      <button type="button" class="close-button" data-cx-dismiss="offcanvas" aria-label="Close"></button>
    </div>
    <div class="offcanvas-body">
      <p>Try scrolling the rest of the page to see this option in action.</p>
    </div>
  </div>`} />

### Static backdrop

When backdrop is set to static, the offcanvas will not close when clicking outside of it, ensuring users must explicitly dismiss the panel.

<Example code={`<button class="button primary" type="button" data-cx-toggle="offcanvas" data-cx-target="#staticBackdrop" aria-controls="staticBackdrop">
    Toggle static offcanvas
  </button>

  <div class="offcanvas offcanvas-start" data-cx-backdrop="static" tabindex="-1" id="staticBackdrop" aria-labelledby="staticBackdropLabel">
    <div class="offcanvas-header">
      <h5 class="offcanvas-title" id="staticBackdropLabel">Offcanvas</h5>
      <button type="button" class="close-button" data-cx-dismiss="offcanvas" aria-label="Close"></button>
    </div>
    <div class="offcanvas-body">
      <div>
        I will not close if you click outside of me.
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>`} />

## Customization options

Tailor offcanvas panels to your specific design and functional requirements with these customization options. Chassis CSS provides comprehensive control over positioning, responsive behavior, and visual presentation.

### Placement options

Offcanvas panels can slide in from any edge of the viewport. Choose the placement that best fits your layout and user experience needs.

<CxTable>
| Placement | Class | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Left | `.offcanvas-start` | Slides in from the left edge (default LTR) |
| Right | `.offcanvas-end` | Slides in from the right edge |
| Top | `.offcanvas-top` | Slides down from the top edge |
| Bottom | `.offcanvas-bottom` | Slides up from the bottom edge |
</CxTable>

#### Top placement

<Example code={`<button class="button primary" type="button" data-cx-toggle="offcanvas" data-cx-target="#offcanvasTop" aria-controls="offcanvasTop">Toggle top offcanvas</button>

  <div class="offcanvas offcanvas-top" tabindex="-1" id="offcanvasTop" aria-labelledby="offcanvasTopLabel">
    <div class="offcanvas-header">
      <h5 class="offcanvas-title" id="offcanvasTopLabel">Offcanvas top</h5>
      <button type="button" class="close-button" data-cx-dismiss="offcanvas" aria-label="Close"></button>
    </div>
    <div class="offcanvas-body">
      This panel slides down from the top of the viewport.
    </div>
  </div>`} />

#### Right placement

<Example code={`<button class="button primary" type="button" data-cx-toggle="offcanvas" data-cx-target="#offcanvasRight" aria-controls="offcanvasRight">Toggle right offcanvas</button>

  <div class="offcanvas offcanvas-end" tabindex="-1" id="offcanvasRight" aria-labelledby="offcanvasRightLabel">
    <div class="offcanvas-header">
      <h5 class="offcanvas-title" id="offcanvasRightLabel">Offcanvas right</h5>
      <button type="button" class="close-button" data-cx-dismiss="offcanvas" aria-label="Close"></button>
    </div>
    <div class="offcanvas-body">
      This panel slides in from the right edge.
    </div>
  </div>`} />

#### Bottom placement

<Example code={`<button class="button primary" type="button" data-cx-toggle="offcanvas" data-cx-target="#offcanvasBottom" aria-controls="offcanvasBottom">Toggle bottom offcanvas</button>

  <div class="offcanvas offcanvas-bottom" tabindex="-1" id="offcanvasBottom" aria-labelledby="offcanvasBottomLabel">
    <div class="offcanvas-header">
      <h5 class="offcanvas-title" id="offcanvasBottomLabel">Offcanvas bottom</h5>
      <button type="button" class="close-button" data-cx-dismiss="offcanvas" aria-label="Close"></button>
    </div>
    <div class="offcanvas-body small">
      This panel slides up from the bottom of the viewport.
    </div>
  </div>`} />

### Responsive behavior

Responsive offcanvas classes hide content outside the viewport from a specified breakpoint and down. Above that breakpoint, the contents within will behave as usual.

<CxTable>
| Class | Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `.offcanvas` | Always behaves as offcanvas |
| `.offcanvas-small` | Offcanvas below small breakpoint |
| `.offcanvas-medium` | Offcanvas below medium breakpoint |
| `.offcanvas-large` | Offcanvas below large breakpoint |
| `.offcanvas-xlarge` | Offcanvas below xlarge breakpoint |
| `.offcanvas-2xlarge` | Offcanvas below 2xlarge breakpoint |
</CxTable>

<Example code={`<button class="button primary d-large-none" type="button" data-cx-toggle="offcanvas" data-cx-target="#offcanvasResponsive" aria-controls="offcanvasResponsive">Toggle offcanvas</button>

  <div class="alert alert-info d-none d-large-block">Resize your browser to show the responsive offcanvas toggle.</div>

  <div class="offcanvas-large offcanvas-end" tabindex="-1" id="offcanvasResponsive" aria-labelledby="offcanvasResponsiveLabel">
    <div class="offcanvas-header">
      <h5 class="offcanvas-title" id="offcanvasResponsiveLabel">Responsive offcanvas</h5>
      <button type="button" class="close-button" data-cx-dismiss="offcanvas" data-cx-target="#offcanvasResponsive" aria-label="Close"></button>
    </div>
    <div class="offcanvas-body">
      <p class="mb-0">This is content within an <code>.offcanvas-large</code>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>`} />

### Accessibility

Since the offcanvas panel is conceptually a modal dialog, be sure to add `aria-labelledby="..."`—referencing the offcanvas title—to `.offcanvas`. Note that you don't need to add `role="dialog"` since we already add it via JavaScript.

## JavaScript

Chassis CSS provides a comprehensive JavaScript API for controlling offcanvas panels programmatically. You can create, show, hide, and configure offcanvas behavior dynamically for complex interactions.

### Data attributes

The simplest way to activate an offcanvas is using data attributes:

```html
<!-- Button to trigger the offcanvas -->
<button data-cx-toggle="offcanvas" data-cx-target="#myOffcanvas">Open panel</button>

<!-- Close button within the offcanvas -->
<button data-cx-dismiss="offcanvas">Close</button>
```

### Initialization

For more control, initialize offcanvas with JavaScript:

```js
// Basic initialization
const myOffcanvas = new chassis.Offcanvas(document.getElementById('myOffcanvas'))

// With a CSS selector
const anotherOffcanvas = new chassis.Offcanvas('#anotherOffcanvas')

// With options
const configuredOffcanvas = new chassis.Offcanvas('#configuredOffcanvas', {
  backdrop: 'static',
  keyboard: false,
  scroll: true
})
```

### Configuration options

<JsDataAttributes />

<CxTable>
| Option | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `backdrop` | boolean, `'static'` | `true` | Apply a backdrop on body while offcanvas is open. Set to `'static'` for a backdrop that doesn't close on click. |
| `keyboard` | boolean | `true` | Closes the offcanvas when escape key is pressed. |
| `scroll` | boolean | `false` | Allow body scrolling while offcanvas is open. |
</CxTable>

### Methods

<Callout name="danger-async-methods" type="danger" />

<CxTable>
| Method | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `show()` | Shows an offcanvas element. Returns before animation completes. |
| `hide()` | Hides an offcanvas element. Returns before animation completes. |
| `toggle()` | Toggles an offcanvas element to shown or hidden. |
| `dispose()` | Destroys an element's offcanvas functionality. |
| `getInstance()` | *Static* method to get the offcanvas instance associated with an element. |
| `getOrCreateInstance()` | *Static* method to get existing offcanvas instance or create a new one. |
</CxTable>

Usage example:

```js
// Initialize with options
const offcanvas = new chassis.Offcanvas('#myOffcanvas', {
  keyboard: false
})

// Show the offcanvas programmatically
document.getElementById('showButton').addEventListener('click', () => {
  offcanvas.show()
})

// Hide after a user action
document.getElementById('completeAction').addEventListener('click', () => {
  // Perform action, then hide offcanvas
  saveData().then(() => offcanvas.hide())
})
```

### Events

Chassis CSS provides events to hook into offcanvas behavior:

<CxTable>
| Event | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `show.cx.offcanvas` | Fires immediately when the `show` method is called. |
| `shown.cx.offcanvas` | Fires when an offcanvas element has been made visible (after animations). |
| `hide.cx.offcanvas` | Fires immediately when the `hide` method is called. |
| `hidden.cx.offcanvas` | Fires when an offcanvas element has been hidden (after animations). |
| `hidePrevented.cx.offcanvas` | Fires when offcanvas hiding is prevented (static backdrop click or keyboard disabled with escape key). |
</CxTable>

Event handling example:

```js
const offcanvasElement = document.getElementById('navigationOffcanvas')

// Do something when offcanvas is about to show
offcanvasElement.addEventListener('show.cx.offcanvas', event => {
  // Update navigation based on current state
  updateNavigation()
})

// Do something when offcanvas is fully shown
offcanvasElement.addEventListener('shown.cx.offcanvas', () => {
  // Focus the first navigation item
  document.getElementById('firstNavItem').focus()
})

// Clean up when offcanvas is hidden
offcanvasElement.addEventListener('hidden.cx.offcanvas', () => {
  // Reset any temporary states
  resetTemporaryStates()
})
```

## Examples

### Offcanvas components

Below is an offcanvas example that is shown by default (via `.show` on `.offcanvas`). Offcanvas includes support for a header with a close button and an optional body class for some initial `padding`. We suggest that you include offcanvas headers with dismiss actions whenever possible, or provide an explicit dismiss action.

<Example class="cxd-example-offcanvas p-0 bg-evident overflow-hidden" code={`<div class="offcanvas offcanvas-start show" tabindex="-1" id="offcanvas" aria-labelledby="offcanvasLabel">
    <div class="offcanvas-header">
      <h5 class="offcanvas-title" id="offcanvasLabel">Offcanvas</h5>
      <button type="button" class="close-button" data-cx-dismiss="offcanvas" aria-label="Close"></button>
    </div>
    <div class="offcanvas-body">
      Content for the offcanvas goes here. You can place just about any Chassis - CSS component or custom elements here.
    </div>
  </div>`} />

### Live demo

Use the buttons below to show and hide an offcanvas element via JavaScript that toggles the `.show` class on an element with the `.offcanvas` class.

- `.offcanvas` hides content (default)
- `.offcanvas.show` shows content

You can use a link with the `href` attribute, or a button with the `data-cx-target` attribute. In both cases, the `data-cx-toggle="offcanvas"` is required.

<Example code={`<a class="button primary" data-cx-toggle="offcanvas" href="#offcanvasExample" role="button" aria-controls="offcanvasExample">
    Link with href
  </a>
  <button class="button primary" type="button" data-cx-toggle="offcanvas" data-cx-target="#offcanvasExample" aria-controls="offcanvasExample">
    Button with data-cx-target
  </button>

  <div class="offcanvas offcanvas-start" tabindex="-1" id="offcanvasExample" aria-labelledby="offcanvasExampleLabel">
    <div class="offcanvas-header">
      <h5 class="offcanvas-title" id="offcanvasExampleLabel">Offcanvas</h5>
      <button type="button" class="close-button" data-cx-dismiss="offcanvas" aria-label="Close"></button>
    </div>
    <div class="offcanvas-body">
      <div>
        Some text as placeholder. In real life you can have the elements you have chosen. Like, text, images, lists, etc.
      </div>
      <div class="dropdown mt-medium">
        <button class="button secondary dropdown-toggle" type="button" data-cx-toggle="dropdown">
          Dropdown button
        </button>
        <ul class="dropdown-menu">
          <li><a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Action</a></li>
          <li><a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Another action</a></li>
          <li><a class="dropdown-item" href="#">Something else here</a></li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>`} />

### Body scrolling

Scrolling the `<body>` element is disabled when an offcanvas and its backdrop are visible. Use the `data-cx-scroll` attribute to enable `<body>` scrolling.

<Example code={`<button class="button primary" type="button" data-cx-toggle="offcanvas" data-cx-target="#offcanvasScrolling" aria-controls="offcanvasScrolling">Enable body scrolling</button>

  <div class="offcanvas offcanvas-start" data-cx-scroll="true" data-cx-backdrop="false" tabindex="-1" id="offcanvasScrolling" aria-labelledby="offcanvasScrollingLabel">
    <div class="offcanvas-header">
      <h5 class="offcanvas-title" id="offcanvasScrollingLabel">Offcanvas with body scrolling</h5>
      <button type="button" class="close-button" data-cx-dismiss="offcanvas" aria-label="Close"></button>
    </div>
    <div class="offcanvas-body">
      <p>Try scrolling the rest of the page to see this option in action.</p>
    </div>
  </div>`} />

### Body scrolling and backdrop

You can also enable `<body>` scrolling with a visible backdrop.

<Example code={`<button class="button primary" type="button" data-cx-toggle="offcanvas" data-cx-target="#offcanvasWithBothOptions" aria-controls="offcanvasWithBothOptions">Enable both scrolling & backdrop</button>

  <div class="offcanvas offcanvas-start" data-cx-scroll="true" tabindex="-1" id="offcanvasWithBothOptions" aria-labelledby="offcanvasWithBothOptionsLabel">
    <div class="offcanvas-header">
      <h5 class="offcanvas-title" id="offcanvasWithBothOptionsLabel">Backdrop with scrolling</h5>
      <button type="button" class="close-button" data-cx-dismiss="offcanvas" aria-label="Close"></button>
    </div>
    <div class="offcanvas-body">
      <p>Try scrolling the rest of the page to see this option in action.</p>
    </div>
  </div>`} />

### Static backdrop

When backdrop is set to static, the offcanvas will not close when clicking outside of it.

<Example code={`<button class="button primary" type="button" data-cx-toggle="offcanvas" data-cx-target="#staticBackdrop" aria-controls="staticBackdrop">
    Toggle static offcanvas
  </button>

  <div class="offcanvas offcanvas-start" data-cx-backdrop="static" tabindex="-1" id="staticBackdrop" aria-labelledby="staticBackdropLabel">
    <div class="offcanvas-header">
      <h5 class="offcanvas-title" id="staticBackdropLabel">Offcanvas</h5>
      <button type="button" class="close-button" data-cx-dismiss="offcanvas" aria-label="Close"></button>
    </div>
    <div class="offcanvas-body">
      <div>
        I will not close if you click outside of me.
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>`} />

## Responsive

<AddedIn version="5.2.0" />

Responsive offcanvas classes hide content outside the viewport from a specified breakpoint and down. Above that breakpoint, the contents within will behave as usual. For example, `.offcanvas-large` hides content in an offcanvas below the `lg` breakpoint, but shows the content above the `lg` breakpoint. Responsive offcanvas classes are available for each breakpoint.

- `.offcanvas`
- `.offcanvas-small`
- `.offcanvas-medium`
- `.offcanvas-large`
- `.offcanvas-xlarge`
- `.offcanvas-2xlarge`

To make a responsive offcanvas, replace the `.offcanvas` base class with a responsive variant and ensure your close button has an explicit `data-cx-target`.

<Example code={`<button class="button primary d-large-none" type="button" data-cx-toggle="offcanvas" data-cx-target="#offcanvasResponsive" aria-controls="offcanvasResponsive">Toggle offcanvas</button>

  <div class="alert alert-info d-none d-large-block">Resize your browser to show the responsive offcanvas toggle.</div>

  <div class="offcanvas-large offcanvas-end" tabindex="-1" id="offcanvasResponsive" aria-labelledby="offcanvasResponsiveLabel">
    <div class="offcanvas-header">
      <h5 class="offcanvas-title" id="offcanvasResponsiveLabel">Responsive offcanvas</h5>
      <button type="button" class="close-button" data-cx-dismiss="offcanvas" data-cx-target="#offcanvasResponsive" aria-label="Close"></button>
    </div>
    <div class="offcanvas-body">
      <p class="mb-0">This is content within an <code>.offcanvas-large</code>.</p>
    </div>
  </div>`} />

## Placement

There’s no default placement for offcanvas components, so you must add one of the modifier classes below.

- `.offcanvas-start` places offcanvas on the left of the viewport (shown above)
- `.offcanvas-end` places offcanvas on the right of the viewport
- `.offcanvas-top` places offcanvas on the top of the viewport
- `.offcanvas-bottom` places offcanvas on the bottom of the viewport

Try the top, right, and bottom examples out below.

<Example code={`<button class="button primary" type="button" data-cx-toggle="offcanvas" data-cx-target="#offcanvasTop" aria-controls="offcanvasTop">Toggle top offcanvas</button>

  <div class="offcanvas offcanvas-top" tabindex="-1" id="offcanvasTop" aria-labelledby="offcanvasTopLabel">
    <div class="offcanvas-header">
      <h5 class="offcanvas-title" id="offcanvasTopLabel">Offcanvas top</h5>
      <button type="button" class="close-button" data-cx-dismiss="offcanvas" aria-label="Close"></button>
    </div>
    <div class="offcanvas-body">
      ...
    </div>
  </div>`} />

<Example code={`<button class="button primary" type="button" data-cx-toggle="offcanvas" data-cx-target="#offcanvasRight" aria-controls="offcanvasRight">Toggle right offcanvas</button>

  <div class="offcanvas offcanvas-end" tabindex="-1" id="offcanvasRight" aria-labelledby="offcanvasRightLabel">
    <div class="offcanvas-header">
      <h5 class="offcanvas-title" id="offcanvasRightLabel">Offcanvas right</h5>
      <button type="button" class="close-button" data-cx-dismiss="offcanvas" aria-label="Close"></button>
    </div>
    <div class="offcanvas-body">
      ...
    </div>
  </div>`} />

<Example code={`<button class="button primary" type="button" data-cx-toggle="offcanvas" data-cx-target="#offcanvasBottom" aria-controls="offcanvasBottom">Toggle bottom offcanvas</button>

  <div class="offcanvas offcanvas-bottom" tabindex="-1" id="offcanvasBottom" aria-labelledby="offcanvasBottomLabel">
    <div class="offcanvas-header">
      <h5 class="offcanvas-title" id="offcanvasBottomLabel">Offcanvas bottom</h5>
      <button type="button" class="close-button" data-cx-dismiss="offcanvas" aria-label="Close"></button>
    </div>
    <div class="offcanvas-body small">
      ...
    </div>
  </div>`} />

## Accessibility

Since the offcanvas panel is conceptually a modal dialog, be sure to add `aria-labelledby="..."`—referencing the offcanvas title—to `.offcanvas`. Note that you don’t need to add `role="dialog"` since we already add it via JavaScript.

## Javascript

The offcanvas plugin utilizes a few classes and attributes to handle the heavy lifting:

- `.offcanvas` hides the content
- `.offcanvas.show` shows the content
- `.offcanvas-start` hides the offcanvas on the left
- `.offcanvas-end` hides the offcanvas on the right
- `.offcanvas-top` hides the offcanvas on the top
- `.offcanvas-bottom` hides the offcanvas on the bottom

Add a dismiss button with the `data-cx-dismiss="offcanvas"` attribute, which triggers the JavaScript functionality. Be sure to use the `<button>` element with it for proper behavior across all devices.

### Data attributes

You can use data attributes to control offcanvas behavior without writing JavaScript. The following attributes are available:

#### Toggle

Add `data-cx-toggle="offcanvas"` and a `data-cx-target` or `href` to the element to automatically assign control of one offcanvas element. The `data-cx-target` attribute accepts a CSS selector to apply the offcanvas to. Be sure to add the class `offcanvas` to the offcanvas element. If you’d like it to default open, add the additional class `show`.

#### Dismiss

<JsDismiss name="offcanvas" />

<Callout type="warning">
While both ways to dismiss an offcanvas are supported, keep in mind that dismissing from outside an offcanvas does not match the [ARIA Authoring Practices Guide dialog (modal) pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/dialogmodal/). Do this at your own risk.
</Callout>

### Initialization

Enable manually with:

```js
const offcanvasElementList = document.querySelectorAll('.offcanvas')
const offcanvasList = [...offcanvasElementList].map(offcanvasEl => new chassis.Offcanvas(offcanvasEl))
```

### Options

<JsDataAttributes />

<CxTable>
| Name | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `backdrop` | boolean or the string `static` | `true` | Apply a backdrop on body while offcanvas is open. Alternatively, specify `static` for a backdrop which doesn’t close the offcanvas when clicked. |
| `keyboard` | boolean | `true` | Closes the offcanvas when escape key is pressed. |
| `scroll` | boolean | `false` | Allow body scrolling while offcanvas is open. |

### Events

Chassis - CSS’s offcanvas class exposes a few events for hooking into offcanvas functionality.

<CxTable>
| Event type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `hide.cx.offcanvas` | This event is fired immediately when the `hide` method has been called. |
| `hidden.cx.offcanvas` | This event is fired when an offcanvas element has been hidden from the user (will wait for CSS transitions to complete). |
| `hidePrevented.cx.offcanvas` | This event is fired when the offcanvas is shown, its backdrop is `static` and a click outside of the offcanvas is performed. The event is also fired when the escape key is pressed and the `keyboard` option is set to `false`. |
| `show.cx.offcanvas` | This event fires immediately when the `show` instance method is called. |
| `shown.cx.offcanvas` | This event is fired when an offcanvas element has been made visible to the user (will wait for CSS transitions to complete). |
</CxTable>

```js
const myOffcanvas = document.getElementById('myOffcanvas')
myOffcanvas.addEventListener('hidden.cx.offcanvas', event => {
  // do something...
})
```
