## How It Works

Chassis accordions leverage the native HTML5 `<details>` and `<summary>` elements, providing several key benefits:

- **Native browser functionality**: The browser handles expanding and collapsing content without requiring extensive JavaScript
- **Built-in accessibility**: Native keyboard navigation and screen reader support through the HTML5 elements
- **Enhanced with JavaScript**: While fully functional without JavaScript, our optional JS adds smooth transitions between states
- **Group behavior**: Using the same `name` attribute on multiple `<details>` elements creates accordion groups where only one item can be open at a time

<Callout name="info-prefersreducedmotion" />

## Examples

Click the accordions below to expand/collapse the content. Each item in this example shares the same `name="example"` attribute, creating a group where only one accordion can be open at a time.

Add the `open` attribute to any `<details>` element to render it expanded by default.

<Example code={`<div class="accordion">
  <details name="example" open>
    <summary>
      <span class="accordion-title">Accordion Item #1</span>
    </summary>
    <div class="accordion-body">
      <p>This is the <b>first item's body</b>, shown by default. It will automatically close when another item is opened by clicking its summary element.</p>
    </div>
  </details>
  <details name="example">
    <summary>
      <span class="accordion-title">Accordion Item #2</span>
    </summary>
    <div class="accordion-body">
      <p>This is the <b>second item's body</b>. It is hidden by default and will open when its summary element is clicked.</p>
    </div>
  </details>
  <details name="example">
    <summary>
      <span class="accordion-title">Accordion Item #3</span>
    </summary>
    <div class="accordion-body">
      <p>This is the <b>third item's body</b>. It is hidden by default and will open when its summary element is clicked.</p>
    </div>
  </details>
</div>`} />

### Headings

<Callout type="warning">
Note that this pattern optimizes screen reader accessibility but uses ARIA role combinations that don't comply with current W3C validation standards. Chassis chooses to prioritize functional accessibility over validation conformance in this case.
</Callout>

Because the `<summary>` element has a `button` role by default (which overrides the roles of its child elements), `heading` elements inside `<summary>` are not recognized by assistive technologies like screen readers.

Fortunately, by swapping the ARIA roles of `<summary>` and `heading` elements and manually setting the `aria-expanded` attribute, you can create accessible accordions with headings using the `<details>` element.

<Example code={`<div class="accordion">
    <details name="example-headings" open>
      <summary role="heading" aria-level="3">
        <h3 class="accordion-title" role="button" aria-expanded="true">Accordion Item #1</h3>
      </summary>
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <p>This is the <b>first item's body</b>, shown by default. It will automatically close when another item is opened by clicking its summary element.</p>
      </div>
    </details>
    <details name="example-headings">
      <summary role="heading" aria-level="3">
        <h3 class="accordion-title" role="button" aria-expanded="false">Accordion Item #2</h3>
      </summary>
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <p>This is the <b>second item's body</b>. It is hidden by default and will open when its summary element is clicked.</p>
      </div>
    </details>
    <details name="example-headings">
      <summary role="heading" aria-level="3">
        <h3 class="accordion-title" role="button" aria-expanded="false">Accordion Item #3</h3>
      </summary>
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <p>This is the <b>third item's body</b>. It is hidden by default and will open when its summary element is clicked.</p>
      </div>
    </details>
  </div>`} />

### Static Items

Accordions with the same `name` attribute form groups that close automatically when another item in the group is opened. Items without a name attribute (or with unique names) remain independent. You can mix both types in a single accordion.

<Example code={`<div class="accordion">
    <details open>
      <summary>
        <span class="accordion-title">Accordion Item #1</span>
      </summary>
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <p>This is the first item's body, shown by default. Since it has <b>no name attribute</b>, it behaves independently and will only close when its own summary element is clicked.</p>
      </div>
    </details>
    <details name="example-static" open>
      <summary>
        <span class="accordion-title">Accordion Item #2</span>
      </summary>
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <p>This item shares the <b>example-static</b> name attribute with Accordion Item #3, forming a group. It will automatically close when <b>Accordion Item #3</b> is opened.</p>
      </div>
    </details>
    <details name="example-static">
      <summary>
        <span class="accordion-title">Accordion Item #3</span>
      </summary>
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <p>This item shares the <b>example-static</b> name attribute with Accordion Item #2, forming a group. It will automatically close when <b>Accordion Item #2</b> is opened.</p>
      </div>
    </details>
  </div>`} />

### Alternate Variant

<InFigma />

Add the `.alternate` class to implement the accordion style that's synchronized with the Figma component library and uses dedicated design tokens.

<Example showMarkup={false} code={`<div class="accordion alternate">
  <details name="example" open>
    <summary>
      <span class="accordion-title">Accordion Item #1</span>
    </summary>
    <div class="accordion-body">
      <p>This is the <b>first item's body</b>, shown by default. It will automatically close when another item is opened by clicking its summary element.</p>
    </div>
  </details>
  <details name="example">
    <summary>
      <span class="accordion-title">Accordion Item #2</span>
    </summary>
    <div class="accordion-body">
      <p>This is the <b>second item's body</b>. It is hidden by default and will open when its summary element is clicked.</p>
    </div>
  </details>
  <details name="example">
    <summary>
      <span class="accordion-title">Accordion Item #3</span>
    </summary>
    <div class="accordion-body">
      <p class="fg-subtle">This is the <b>third item's body</b>. It is hidden by default and will open when its summary element is clicked.</p>
    </div>
  </details>
</div>`} />

<Code lang="html" code={`<div class="accordion alternate">
    ...
  </div>`} />

<Callout name="info-figma-variant" />

### Flush Accordion

Add `.flush` to remove some borders and rounded corners to render accordions edge-to-edge with their parent container.

<div class="cxd-example">

  <div class="accordion flush">
    <details name="example-flush" open>
      <summary>
        <span class="accordion-title">Accordion Item #1</span>
      </summary>
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <p>This is the <b>first item's body</b>, shown by default. It will automatically close when another item is opened by clicking its summary element.</p>
      </div>
    </details>
    <details name="example-flush">
      <summary>
        <span class="accordion-title">Accordion Item #2</span>
      </summary>
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <p>This is the <b>second item's body</b>. It is hidden by default and will open when its summary element is clicked.</p>
      </div>
    </details>
    <details name="example-flush">
      <summary>
        <span class="accordion-title">Accordion Item #3</span>
      </summary>
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <p>This is the <b>third item's body</b>. It is hidden by default and will open when its summary element is clicked.</p>
      </div>
    </details>
  </div>

</div>

```html
  <div class="accordion flush">
    ...
  </div>
```

### Indicator Position

Add `.indicator-end` to the accordion container to move the indicator icon to the end of the summary element.

<div class="cxd-example">

  <div class="accordion indicator-end">
    <details name="example-end" open>
      <summary>
        <span class="accordion-title">Accordion Item #1</span>
      </summary>
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <p>This is the <b>first item's body</b>, shown by default. It will automatically close when another item is opened by clicking its summary element.</p>
      </div>
    </details>
    <details name="example-end">
      <summary>
        <span class="accordion-title">Accordion Item #2</span>
      </summary>
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <p>This is the <b>second item's body</b>. It is hidden by default and will open when its summary element is clicked.</p>
      </div>
    </details>
    <details name="example-end">
      <summary>
        <span class="accordion-title">Accordion Item #3</span>
      </summary>
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <p>This is the <b>third item's body</b>. It is hidden by default and will open when its summary element is clicked.</p>
      </div>
    </details>
  </div>

</div>

```html
  <div class="accordion indicator-end">
    ...
  </div>
```

### Disable Animation

Add `.no-transition` to the accordion container to disable the smooth transition effect.

<div class="cxd-example">

  <div class="accordion no-transition">
    <details name="example-no-transition" open>
      <summary>
        <span class="accordion-title">Accordion Item #1</span>
      </summary>
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <p>This is the <b>first item's body</b>, shown by default. It will automatically close when another item is opened by clicking its summary element.</p>
      </div>
    </details>
    <details name="example-no-transition">
      <summary>
        <span class="accordion-title">Accordion Item #2</span>
      </summary>
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <p>This is the <b>second item's body</b>. It is hidden by default and will open when its summary element is clicked.</p>
      </div>
    </details>
    <details name="example-no-transition">
      <summary>
        <span class="accordion-title">Accordion Item #3</span>
      </summary>
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <p>This is the <b>third item's body</b>. It is hidden by default and will open when its summary element is clicked.</p>
      </div>
    </details>
  </div>

</div>

```html
  <div class="accordion no-transition">
    ...
  </div>
```

## Sizes

<InFigma plural={true} />

Chassis CSS offers size variations to help accordions integrate seamlessly with different UI contexts. Adjust sizes to establish visual hierarchy and optimize space utilization based on your layout requirements.

### Large

Add `.large` for larger font size and more generous spacing. Suitable for primary content areas, FAQ sections, or hero elements where accordions need more visual prominence.

<div class="cxd-example">

  <div class="accordion large">
    <details name="example-large" open>
      <summary>
        <span class="accordion-title">Accordion Item #1</span>
      </summary>
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <p>This is the <b>first item's body</b>, shown by default. It will automatically close when another item is opened by clicking its summary element.</p>
      </div>
    </details>
    <details name="example-large">
      <summary>
        <span class="accordion-title">Accordion Item #2</span>
      </summary>
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <p>This is the <b>second item's body</b>. It is hidden by default and will open when its summary element is clicked.</p>
      </div>
    </details>
    <details name="example-large">
      <summary>
        <span class="accordion-title">Accordion Item #3</span>
      </summary>
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <p>This is the <b>third item's body</b>. It is hidden by default and will open when its summary element is clicked.</p>
      </div>
    </details>
  </div>

</div>

```html
  <div class="accordion large">
    ...
  </div>
```

### Small

Add `.small` for reduced font size and compact spacing. Suitable for secondary content areas like cards, sidebars, or dense layouts where space efficiency is a priority.

<div class="cxd-example">

  <div class="accordion small">
    <details name="example-small" open>
      <summary>
        <span class="accordion-title">Accordion Item #1</span>
      </summary>
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <p>This is the <b>first item's body</b>, shown by default. It will automatically close when another item is opened by clicking its summary element.</p>
      </div>
    </details>
    <details name="example-small">
      <summary>
        <span class="accordion-title">Accordion Item #2</span>
      </summary>
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <p>This is the <b>second item's body</b>. It is hidden by default and will open when its summary element is clicked.</p>
      </div>
    </details>
    <details name="example-small">
      <summary>
        <span class="accordion-title">Accordion Item #3</span>
      </summary>
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <p>This is the <b>third item's body</b>. It is hidden by default and will open when its summary element is clicked.</p>
      </div>
    </details>
  </div>

</div>

```html
<div class="accordion small">
  ...
</div>
```

## Context Variants

<CSSOnly />

You can use the `.context` class to add a color or style to the accordion. The context class is used to apply a specific color scheme or style to the accordion, making it visually distinct and aligned with your design preferences. See [context class]([[docsref:core-concepts/context-class]]) for more information.

### Colors

Use `.context` class on accordion with a color, like `.primary`.

<div class="cxd-example">
  <div class="row row-cols-1 row-cols-medium-2 g-large">

<div class="col">
  <div class="accordion context neutral small">
    <details name="example-neutral" open>
      <summary>
        <span class="accordion-title">Accordion Item #1</span>
      </summary>
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <p>This is the <b>first item's body</b>, shown by default. It will automatically close when another item is opened by clicking its summary element.</p>
      </div>
    </details>
    <details name="example-neutral">
      <summary>
        <span class="accordion-title">Accordion Item #2</span>
      </summary>
      <div class="accordion-body">
        <p>This is the <b>second item's body</b>. It is hidden by default and will open when its summary element is clicked.</p>

## Accessibility

The accordion component leverages the native HTML5 `<details>` and `<summary>` elements, which provide built-in accessibility features including keyboard navigation, focus management, and appropriate ARIA states without additional JavaScript. This ensures users of assistive technologies can interact with accordions using standard navigation patterns.

### Using Headings

<Callout type="warning">
Note that this pattern optimizes screen reader accessibility but uses ARIA role combinations that don't comply with current W3C validation standards. Chassis chooses to prioritize functional accessibility over validation conformance in this case.
</Callout>

Because the `<summary>` element has a `button` role by default (which overrides the roles of its child elements), heading elements inside `<summary>` are not recognized by assistive technologies like screen readers.

To create accessible accordions with proper heading hierarchy, swap the ARIA roles between the `<summary>` and heading elements:

1. Add `role="heading"` and `aria-level` attributes to the `<summary>` element.
2. Add `role="button"` and `aria-expanded` attributes to the heading element inside.

This ensures screen readers correctly announce both the heading structure and the interactive button functionality.

- The `aria-level` should match the appropriate heading level in the document hierarchy.
- The `aria-expanded` attribute will be automatically managed by the accordion JavaScript.

For example:
```html
<details>
  <summary role="heading" aria-level="3">
    <h3 class="accordion-title" role="button" aria-expanded="false">Accordion Item #1</h3>
  </summary>
  <div class="accordion-body">
    <!-- Content -->
  </div>
</details>
```

This approach preserves the document's heading structure while maintaining the interactive behavior expected from accordion components.
