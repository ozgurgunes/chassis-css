## Overview

Chassis CSS provides a complete form styling system built on modern CSS practices. The framework enhances the base [form styles in the Reboot module]([[docsref:/content/reboot#forms]]) with specialized classes for consistent rendering across browsers and devices.

Form components utilize CSS variables for theming, making them highly customizable while maintaining visual consistency. This approach allows easy adaptation to different design systems and color schemes.

Always use appropriate HTML5 `type` attributes on input elements (e.g., `email`, `number`, `tel`) to leverage built-in browser validation and specialized input controls for better user experience.

Here's a basic example demonstrating Chassis CSS form elements:

<Example code={`<form>
    <div class="mb-medium">
      <label for="exampleInputEmail1" class="form-label">Email address</label>
      <input type="email" class="form-input" id="exampleInputEmail1" aria-describedby="emailHelp">
      <div id="emailHelp" class="form-assist">We'll never share your email with anyone else.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="mb-medium">
      <label for="exampleInputPassword1" class="form-label">Password</label>
      <input type="password" class="form-input" id="exampleInputPassword1">
    </div>
    <div class="mb-medium form-option">
      <input type="checkbox" class="option-input" id="exampleCheck1">
      <label class="option-label" for="exampleCheck1">Check me out</label>
    </div>
    <button type="submit" class="button primary">Submit</button>
  </form>`} />

## Disabled forms

Apply the `disabled` boolean attribute to an input element to prevent user interactions and provide visual feedback by changing its appearance.

```html
<input class="form-input" id="disabledInput" type="text" placeholder="Disabled input here..." disabled>
```

To disable multiple form controls at once, add the `disabled` attribute to a parent `<fieldset>` element. All native form elements (`<input>`, `<select>`, and `<button>`) within a disabled fieldset will be programmatically disabled and visually styled accordingly.

For custom interactive elements like `<a class="button">` within a disabled fieldset, Chassis CSS applies `pointer-events: none` to prevent mouse interactions. However, for complete accessibility, you should manually add `tabindex="-1"` to prevent keyboard focus and `aria-disabled="disabled"` to communicate the disabled state to assistive technologies.

<Example code={`<form>
    <fieldset disabled>
      <legend>Disabled fieldset example</legend>
      <div class="mb-medium">
        <label for="disabledTextInput" class="form-label">Disabled input</label>
        <input type="text" id="disabledTextInput" class="form-input" placeholder="Disabled input">
      </div>
      <div class="mb-medium">
        <label for="disabledSelect" class="form-label">Disabled select menu</label>
        <select id="disabledSelect" class="form-select">
          <option>Disabled select</option>
        </select>
      </div>
      <div class="mb-medium">
        <div class="form-option">
          <input class="option-input" type="checkbox" id="disabledFieldsetCheck">
          <label class="option-label" for="disabledFieldsetCheck">
            Can't check this
          </label>
        </div>
      </div>
      <button type="submit" class="button primary">Submit</button>
    </fieldset>
  </form>`} />

## Accessibility

Creating accessible forms is essential for users of assistive technologies. Chassis CSS form components are designed with accessibility in mind, but proper implementation requires attention to the following principles:

### Accessible naming techniques

Every form control must have an accessible name that clearly communicates its purpose to assistive technology users. Without proper naming, users of screen readers and other assistive devices cannot understand what information is being requested.

**Use explicit labels**

- Connect inputs with labels using the `for` attribute that matches the input's `id`
- Place checkboxes and radios inside label elements for automatic association

**When visible labels aren't possible:**

- Visually hidden labels using the `.visually-hidden` utility class
- Reference existing content with `aria-labelledby`
- Add descriptive `title` attributes (not recommended as primary method)
- Use `aria-label` for concise, explicit naming

Never rely solely on `placeholder` attributes for accessible naming, as placeholders:

- Disappear when the field contains content
- Often have low color contrast
- Cannot be accessed by all assistive technologies consistently

### State communication

Form controls should communicate their states (required, invalid, disabled) both visually and programmatically:

- Use the `required` attribute for mandatory fields
- Implement `aria-invalid="true"` for validation errors
- Ensure error messages are associated with their fields using `aria-describedby`

For detailed implementation guidance, refer to the accessibility section in each form component's documentation.

## CSS variables and theming

Chassis CSS forms use a comprehensive system of CSS variables to enable consistent styling and easy theming. The framework applies a state-based approach where form elements adapt their appearance based on:

- Idle state (default appearance)
- Focus state (when interacted with)
- Disabled state (when not available)
- Validation states (error, success)

These states are implemented through CSS variables with predictable naming patterns:

```css
/* Example of state-based CSS variables */
--cx-idle-bg-regular: #fff;        /* Background in idle state */
--cx-focus-border-color: #0d6efd;  /* Border color in focus state */
--cx-error-assist-color: #dc3545;  /* Text color for error messages */
```

This approach allows for:
- Consistent appearance across all form elements
- Easy theming by modifying a small set of root variables
- Support for both default and alternate color schemes
- Simplified implementation of dark mode and custom themes

Additionally, size variants (small, medium, large) are available for all form components through either:
- CSS classes (`.small`, `.large`)
- SCSS placeholders (`%form-size-small`, `%form-size-large`)
