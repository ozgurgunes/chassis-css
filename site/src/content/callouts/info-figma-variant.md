Note that the `.alternate` class used here creates a distinct visual style and is different from the `.context.alternate` class combination shown in the [Context Variants](#context-variants) section. The `.alternate` class applies a specific style with bound tokens synced from Figma, while `.context.alternate` is CSS-only and follows [Context Class]([[docsref:/core-concepts/context-class]]) patterns.
